# differences between app and topalias
- no interface to add alias and just suggesting alias
- no detection if alias is already present or suggesting same alias for different applications.
- only has basic first letter based suggestions.
- does not ignore basic commands like nvim
- algorithm based solely on frequency not on time and length.
- alias for multiple command sequence not available.
