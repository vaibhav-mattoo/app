- Alman --get-suggestions is slow on bash, need to figure out why
- add source message on cli changes and maybe make an alias for sourcing on default
- add eval line on install
- detect if the database isnt updating for commands with >1 word or >=5 letters and  send a prompt to the user to add a "eval" line in .bashrc
- remove --command from add
-  change alias doesnt require the command as an arguement and also it doesnt work currently, messed with the alias list as well
