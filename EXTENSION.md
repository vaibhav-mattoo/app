# Extension ideas for generic terminal speedup

- autocorrect of mistyped commands powered by command data structure and frequent usage compared with current mistyped command and if similarity score above a limit provide a suggestion to fix the command.
- providing an alias for multiple consecutive commands used in a sequence with minor changes in arguments.
- provide remainder to do system update and system cleanup using <https://averagelinuxuser.com/clean-arch-linux/>
- want ability to be able to change history file and alias file through command line option, also detect what the default is by checking shell.
